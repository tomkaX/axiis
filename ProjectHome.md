Axiis has been designed to be a concise, expressive, and modular framework that let developers and designers create compelling data visualization solutions by assembling easy to understand building blocks into simple or complex visual representations of data.

Axiis takes a very visual approach to development in both the markup language itself as well as the concepts used to create data visualizations.

The two primary concepts to understand in Axiis are Geometry and Layout.

Geometry:  All data visualizations are ultimately represented as one or more sets of simple or complex geometries that plot specific data points relative to visual coordinates.   To that end, Axiis leverages the Degrafa framework to describe its geometries.

Layout:  The Axiis layout classes are the heart of the framework, as they allow the developer to describe in simple terms how they want to translate sets of data into geometric representations.   The layout classes allow developers to use and combine pre-built layout schemes as well as build their own to create anything from standard cartesian charts to wild yet-to-be imagined data visualizations.

<b>A note about how we use version control:</b><br />
Like the Degrafa Team, we use our branches to do development and only push code to the trunk when it is ready for release. Therefore, the trunk will always contain the same code as the latest tag. The "development" branch is where all the cutting-edge work happens. Bug fixes and new features will be added there long before they make their way to the trunk and tags.
